 Linear algebra and coding are rapidly becoming an essential foundation for the modern engineer in a computational world. Students in this course will gain insights into the mathematical theory of linear algebra and its realization in practical computational tools.

Math is the language of engineering, but coding is believing and realizing it. The mathematical content of ROB 101 is built around systems of linear equations, their representation as matrices, and numerical methods for their analysis. These methods are given life through the lens of robotics and contemporary intelligent systems and their compelling applications.
