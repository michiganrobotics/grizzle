**Advert from a student in Fall 2024:** Fellow students, when fulfilling your math requirements, you have two pathways to choose from. The first is the traditional route: 12 credits of Calculus courses offered by Michigan’s Math Department, taken over three semesters. This pathway focuses heavily on theory, often without connecting the material to real-world applications in engineering and the sciences.

 The second option is **ROB 201: Calculus for the Modern Engineer**, a streamlined 4-credit course completed in a single semester. Designed for students in robotics, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, aerospace engineering, computer science, physics, and naval architecture, ROB 201 focuses on the most critical aspects of calculus while emphasizing practical applications. You’ll not only learn what calculus is but also why it matters and how to use it in solving real-world problems.

Students who take ROB 201 emerge better prepared for upper-level courses in their disciplines, with a stronger foundation in applied math. Taught by a professor with extensive experience in engineering and applied mathematics, this course ensures a meaningful, efficient, and practical calculus education.

The choice is clear: ROB 201 offers a modern, application-focused approach to calculus that’s perfect for today’s engineers and scientists.
