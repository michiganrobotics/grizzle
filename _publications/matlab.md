**Copyright:** These models belong to me and/or my students. You may use them for your own ends as long as you cite their source, preferably a publication of ours where they were either introduced, used or analyzed. **Important:** These models come with no guarantee of accuracy and no support. If you have a problem with one of them, do not email me; read the paper from whence it came and build it yourself! Nevertheless, many of you will find any models placed here to be useful. I do hope that they are bug free, but I do not guarantee this and I do not accept any responsibility for their use or misuse. Many students are using these models as sources for projects.

Models in MATLAB Format
=======================

1.  [Planar Biped Models](http://ece.umich.edu/faculty/grizzle/westervelt_thesis/code/). The three link model is nicely explained in J.W. Grizzle, Gabriel Abba and Franck Plestan, [Asymptotically Stable Walking for Biped Robots: Analysis via Systems with Impulse Effects.](papers/biped.pdf) _Reprint,_ IEEE T-AC, Volume 46, No. 1, January 2001, pp. 51-64. [revised version.](papers/biped_rev.pdf) The five link model is explained in E.R. Westervelt, J.W. Grizzle, and D.E. Koditschek, [Hybrid Zero Dynamics of Planar Biped Walkers.](papers/hybrid_zdyn_TAC.pdf) _Reprint,_ IEEE-TAC, Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2003, pp. 42-56.[\[**Supplemental Material**\]](Hybrid-Zero-Dynamics-of-Planar-Biped-Robots-Supplemental-Material.html), and also Franck Plestan, J.W. Grizzle, Eric Westervelt and Gabriel Abba, [Stable Walking of a 7-DOF Biped Robot.](papers/stable_7DOF_walker_rev.pdf) _Preprint,_ to appear in IEEE Trans. Robotics and Automation, March 2002. [\[**Supplemental Material**\]](IEEE-TRA-Submission-Supplemental-Material.html). [Original submission](papers/stable_7DOF_walker.pdf), Feb. 2001.
2.  [Dynamic O2 storage model for a TWC](papers/TWC_O2_Storage.zip). The model is based on work by E.P. Brandt, Y. Wang and J.W. Grizzle, [Dynamic Modeling of a Three-Way Catalyst for SI Engine Exhaust Emission Control.](papers/TWC98.pdf) _Reprint,_ IEEE T-Control Technology, Vol. 8, No. 5, September 2000, pp. 767-776.
