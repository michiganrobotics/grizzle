My [ORCID Number](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7586-0142) is 0000-0001-7586-0142. My Google Scholar page is [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=heYuqBkAAAAJ).

I have classified my papers according to the various areas in which I work. If a paper in an _application_ domain contains some new nonlinear theory, then the paper is listed in the nonlinear category as well. The files are in Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf).

**Caution!** The electronic versions of these papers may differ somewhat from the final published versions. I am distributing the electronic files so that readers can _preview_ the papers. If you find the paper of potential interest, or if you plan to cite the work, then please obtain the original.
