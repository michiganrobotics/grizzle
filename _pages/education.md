For Michigan Robotics, I designed, developed, and taught:

*   [**ROB 101 Computational Linear Algebra** (piloted Fall 2020)](rob101.html)
*   [**ROB 201 Calculus for the Modern Engineer** (piloted Fall 2024)](rob201.html)
*   [**ROB 501 Mathematics for Robotics** (piloted Fall 2014)](rob501.html)


 The material for ROB 101, 201, and 501 has been open-sourced. 

 
From 1987 to 2020, I  taught courses primarily in the areas of feedback control and applied mathematics for engineering. At the University of Michigan's EECS Department, these included:

- **EECS 216 Signals and Systems**
- **EECS 460 Control Systems Analysis and Design**
- **EECS 560 Linear Systems Theory**
- **EECS 562 Nonlinear Systems and Control**
- **EECS 600 Function Space Methods for Systems Theory**
- **EECS 662 Advanced Nonlinear Control**

Course notes for the EECS courses have been passed on to Professors Necmiye Ozay and Dimitra (Mika) Panagou. 

**For Undergraduates Wanting to Learn Control of Bipedal Locomotion:** [Dr. Wami Ogunbi's Bipedal Bootcamp](https://wamiogunbi.com/biped-bootcamp)
 
 **Research Monograph** [Feedback Control of Dynamic Bipedal Robot Locomotion](https://grizzle.robotics.umich.edu/publications/biped-book) co-authored with Eric R. Westervelt, Christine Chevallereau, Jun-Ho Choi, and Benjamin Morris, published by Taylor & Francis in June, 2007, **is available for free  [download](/files/Westervelt_biped_control_book_15_May_2007.pdf)**. It treats virtual constraints and hybrid zero dynamics for the creation of asymptotically stable periodic motions in hybrid systems. I would also suggest the following papers that significantly extend these methods: [Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02223),  [Zero Dynamics and Low-order Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08170), [MPC and Virtual Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14862), [Robust Optimization](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0278364917708249), and [Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (BMI)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0278364915593400). **Tutorial material:** [2018 HZD Review paper by Ames and Poulakakis](http://ames.caltech.edu/HZD_bookchapter.pdf), [Book Chapter In: Goswami A., Vadakkepat P. (eds) Humanoid Robotics: A Reference. Springer, Dordrecht](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01127), and [2015 Survey on HZD in Automatica](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005109814001654).
