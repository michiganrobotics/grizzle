Since 1985, I have taught courses primarily in the areas of feedback control and applied mathematics for engineering. At the University of Michigan's EECS Department, these included:

- **EECS 216 Signals and Systems**
- **EECS 460 Control Systems Analysis and Design**
- **EECS 560 Linear Systems Theory**
- **EECS 562 Nonlinear Systems and Control**
- **EECS 600 Function Space Methods for Systems Theory**
- **EECS 662 Advanced Nonlinear Control**

Course notes for the EECS courses have been passed on to Professors Necmiye Ozay and Dimitra (Mika) Panagou. For Michigan Robotics, I designed, developed, and taught:

*   [ROB 101 Computational Linear Algebra (piloted Fall 2020)](pages/rob101.html)
*   [**ROB 201 Calculus for the Modern Engineer** (piloted Fall 2024)](rob201.html)
*   [**ROB 501 Mathematics for Robotics** (piloted Fall 2014)](rob501.html)


 The material for ROB 101 and 501 has been open-sourced. The material for ROB 201 will be made open source in early 2025.

 ==========ROB 101=============

 Linear algebra and coding are rapidly becoming an essential foundation for the modern engineer in a computational world. Students in this course will gain insights into the mathematical theory of linear algebra and its realization in practical computational tools.

Math is the language of engineering, but coding is believing and realizing it. The mathematical content of ROB 101 is built around systems of linear equations, their representation as matrices, and numerical methods for their analysis. These methods are given life through the lens of robotics and contemporary intelligent systems and their compelling applications.

 ==========ROB 501=============

ROB 501: Mathematics for Robotics, is a graduate-level course at the University of Michigan that introduces applied mathematics for robotics engineers.

Topics include vector spaces, orthogonal bases, projection theorem, least squares, matrix factorizations, Kalman filter and underlying probabilistic concepts, norms, convergent sequences, contraction mappings, Newton Raphson algorithm, local vs global convergence in nonlinear optimization, convexity, linear and quadratic programs.
