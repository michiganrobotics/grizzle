Since 1985, I have taught courses primarily in the areas of feedback control and applied mathematics for engineering. At the University of Michigan's EECS Department, these included:

- **EECS 216 Signals and Systems**
- **EECS 460 Control Systems Analysis and Design**
- **EECS 560 Linear Systems Theory**
- **EECS 562 Nonlinear Systems and Control**
- **EECS 600 Function Space Methods for Systems Theory**
- **EECS 662 Advanced Nonlinear Control**

For Michigan Robotics, I designed, developed, and taught:

- **ROB 101 Computational Linear Algebra**
- **ROB 201 Calculus for the Modern Engineer**
- **ROB 501 Mathematics for Robotics**

Course notes for the EECS courses have been passed on to Professors Necmiye Ozay and Dimitra (Mika) Panagou. The material for
