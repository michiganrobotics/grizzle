**Bipedal Robots:** From January 1999 to April 2024, my graduate students and I spearheaded pioneering research that fundamentally transformed the realm of feedback control in agile bipedal locomotion. Prior to our efforts, the consensus was that the complexity of models in bipedal robotics made analytical approaches impratical. We discovered that a technique from geometric nonlinear control—specifically, Zero Dynamics—could be adeptly applied to these complex hybrid dynamical models. This breakthrough not only enabled us to thoroughly analyze but also to radically enhance the design of feedback algorithms for bipedal robots. By turning traditional methods from nonlinear control on their head and merging them with numerical optimization, we established a robust design methodology now known as Hybrid Zero Dynamics (HZD). This approach has redefined standards in the field, seamlessly integrating theoretical frameworks with practical engineering applications, demonstrated by my team and others on a wide variety of bipedal robots. Our work has significantly advanced the theoretical foundations of the field and has catalyzed innovations in robotic mobility and autonomy.
