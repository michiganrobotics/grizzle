Jessy W. Grizzle is a (full) Professor in the [Biped Robotics Laboratory](https://www.biped.solutions) of the [Robotics Department](http://robotics.umich.edu/) within the [College of Engineering](http://www.engin.umich.edu/) at [The University of Michigan](http://www.umich.edu/) in [Ann Arbor](https://www.a2gov.org), [Michigan](https://www.michigan.gov/).. 


The activity at [Michigan in control systems](https://controls.engin.umich.edu/) is very interdisciplinary and moves easily across traditional departmental boundaries. We maintain a very active [College of Engineering Control Seminar Series](https://controls.engin.umich.edu/seminars/).

Book: [Feedback Control of Dynamic Bipedal Robot Locomotion](https://grizzle.robotics.umich.edu/publications/biped-book) co-authored with Eric R. Westervelt, Christine Chevallereau, Jun-Ho Choi, and Benjamin Morris, published by Taylor & Francis in June, 2007, **is available for free  [download](/files/Westervelt_biped_control_book_15_May_2007.pdf)**. It treats virtual constraints and hybrid zero dynamics for the creation of asymptotically stable periodic motions in hybrid systems. I would also suggest the following papers that significantly extend these methods: [Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02223), [Robust Optimization](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0278364917708249), and [Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (BMI)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0278364915593400), and the excellent [2018 HZD Review paper by Ames and Poulakakis](http://ames.caltech.edu/HZD_bookchapter.pdf), as well as these survey works: [Book Chapter In: Goswami A., Vadakkepat P. (eds) Humanoid Robotics: A Reference. Springer, Dordrecht](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01127) and [2015 Survey on HZD in Automatica](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005109814001654).

My primary research area used to be the theory of nonlinear control systems. While I still have strong interest in this subject and feel a sense of community with that body of researchers, my research activities have significantly broadened over time. My work now covers the control of bipedal robots and correct-by-construction control methods for Advanced Driver Assist Systems. From 1986 to 2010, I worked on various aspects of modeling and control of automotive powertrain systems and control of HEVs. From 1991-2001, I applied systems and control techniques to improve the operation of plasma-based microelectronics manufacturing equipment.
