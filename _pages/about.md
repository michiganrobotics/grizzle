    <p>Dear Students and Colleagues,</p>
    <p>After a rewarding and impactful journey in research, I have concluded this chapter of my academic career. As of January 2024, following the successful defenses of my last PhD students, I have officially closed my aboratory. Moving forward, I will no longer supervise PhDs, MS students, or Post-docs. Instead, my focus shifts passionately toward undergraduate teaching and dedicating my efforts to supporting Michigan Robotics. This transition marks not an end, but a new chapter where I aim to inspire and mold future generations of engineers with the wisdom gained from decades of research, teaching, and professional service. Thank you for your continued support and collaboration.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>Prof. Jessy Grizzle</p>

My primary research area used to be the theory of nonlinear control systems. While I still have strong interest in this subject and feel a sense of community with that body of researchers, my research activities have significantly broadened over time. My work now covers the control of bipedal robots and correct-by-construction control methods for Advanced Driver Assist Systems. From 1986 to 2010, I worked on various aspects of modeling and control of automotive powertrain systems and control of HEVs. From 1991-2001, I applied systems and control techniques to improve the operation of plasma-based microelectronics manufacturing equipment.
