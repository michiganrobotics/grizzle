    <p>Dear Students and Colleagues,</p>
    <p>After a rewarding and impactful journey in research, I have concluded this chapter of my academic career. As of January 2024, following the successful defenses of my last PhD students, I have officially closed my aboratory. Moving forward, I will no longer supervise PhDs, MS students, or Post-docs. Instead, my focus shifts passionately toward undergraduate teaching and dedicating my efforts to supporting Michigan Robotics. This transition marks not an end, but a new chapter where I aim to inspire and mold future generations of engineers with the wisdom gained from decades of research, teaching, and professional service. Thank you for your continued support and collaboration.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>Prof. Jessy Grizzle</p>
